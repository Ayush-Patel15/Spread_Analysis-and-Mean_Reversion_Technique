    "### Pairs Trading and the Mean Reversion Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairs trading is a market-neutral strategy that profits from temporary deviations between two related assets. When two stocks exhibit cointegration, their prices move together in the long term, even if they temporarily deviate from their typical relationship. The key idea is to identify these deviations, assuming the spread between them will revert to its historical mean. Here’s how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying a Pair: Two cointegrated stocks, let’s call them Stock A and Stock B, have a stable spread between their prices over time.\n",
    "- Monitoring the Spread: If the spread widens significantly (e.g., Z-score > +2SD), Stock A may be considered overvalued, and Stock B undervalued. Spread is just any linear relationship between the Stock A and Stock B.\n",
    "- Trading Signals: Go Long (Buy) on the undervalued stock and Go Short (Sell) on the overvalued stock when the spread deviates significantly. Close the trade when the spread reverts to the mean, realizing a profit.\n",
    "- Risk Management: By pairing long and short positions, pairs trading minimizes exposure to broader market trends and focuses on the relationship between the two assets."

    "### Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive directly to the main topic, and learn the steps involved in research of finding Mean Reverting pairs. For this demonstration, I am using the output of one of my previous post, where I have saved a dataframe with the pairs and their verdict of `cointegrated` or `not-cointegrated`. I will filter out the pairs that are cointegrated and follow the below steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "`STEP-1`: Use OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression to find the relationship between the pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply an OLS regression to fit a linear model between the two stocks in each cointegrated pair.\n",
    "- The regression equation models one stock as a function of the other, helping compute the spread between them.\n",
    "- Swap the (X, Y) and choose the pair, which has the minimum standard error. To keep this document simple, I have not tested the swapper relationship of instruments. (But it's easy, interested people can do that).\n",
    "\n",
    "`STEP-2`: Create the Spread using the Beta/Slope coeficient of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In pairs trading, this beta is called as the hedge ratio.\n",
    "- Compute the spread as the linear equation: stock_y - (hedge_ratio * stock_x), where x and y are the dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "- The spread represents the linear combination of their expected relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "`STEP-3`: Apply the stationarity test on the created spread series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to verify if the spread is stationary.\n",
    "- A stationary spread is crucial for pairs trading, as it suggests the spread will revert to its historical mean over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "`STEP-4`: If the spread is stationary, generate the Z-Score Series\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalize the spread by calculating its Z-score to measure how far it deviates from the mean.\n",
    "- This step helps define boundaries for typical versus extreme deviations.\n",
    "$$ Z(t) = (Spread(t) - \\mu_s) / \\sigma_s $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu_s$ is the mean and $\\sigma_s$ is the standard deviation of the spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "`STEP-5`: Plot the Z-Score Series, and save the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualize the Z-score series with statistical boundaries at the mean, +2SD, and -2SD.\n",
    "- Highlight key points where the spread crosses these thresholds to identify potential trading signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot have the pairs to analyze and decide, whether to trade or apply the mean reversion pairs trading logic or not."

    "- Assumption of Stationarity: The success of pairs trading hinges on the assumption that the spread between cointegrated pairs is stationary and will revert to its mean over time. However, market conditions can change, causing previously stationary relationships to break down.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Selection Bias: Choosing the right pairs is critical. Poor pair selection can lead to false signals and suboptimal trading outcomes. The process often involves extensive data analysis and rigorous testing to ensure robust results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market Regimes and Structural Shifts: Unexpected macroeconomic events or structural changes in industries can permanently shift relationships between pairs, rendering historical patterns invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execution Risk: Delays in trade execution can result in missed opportunities or increased losses. High-frequency market movements may reduce the efficiency of pairs trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation vs. Cointegration: Pairs trading requires cointegration, not just correlation. Two highly correlated stocks may not maintain a stable spread, leading to potential strategy failure if cointegration is not carefully verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transaction Costs and Slippage: Frequent trading to capture small deviations can result in significant transaction costs and slippage, eroding potential profits."
